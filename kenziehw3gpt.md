### Q
I'm helping my daughter with some stats homework. I have math knowledge but the following question has different notation than I'm used to (the carrot symbol goes above the second Y): Plot the deviations  Yi−^Yi against  Xi on one graph.   Plot the deviations Yi−^Yi against Xi  on another graph

### A
It looks like you're dealing with the residuals from a regression analysis. In the context of simple linear regression:

- \( Y_i \) represents the actual observed values of the dependent variable.
- \( \hat{Y_i} \) represents the predicted values of the dependent variable (usually from a regression line).
- \( X_i \) represents the values of the independent variable.

The term \( Y_i - \hat{Y_i} \) is known as the residual or the error term. It measures the difference between the actual observed value and the value predicted by the regression model.

Given the question:

1. **Plot the deviations \( Y_i - \hat{Y_i} \) against \( X_i \) on one graph.**

   This plot will show you the residuals of your regression analysis against the independent variable \( X_i \). It's a common diagnostic plot in regression analysis to identify non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers. 

2. **Plot the deviations \( Y_i - \hat{Y_i} \) against \( \hat{Y_i} \) on another graph.**

   This is the standard residuals versus fitted values plot. This plot is used to detect non-linearity, unequal error variances, and outliers. If your model is well-fitted, you should see a random scatter in this plot. Any pattern might be a sign that your model doesn't capture some structure in the data.

To help with these plots, you'd usually turn to a statistical software or programming language with statistical libraries. For example, in Python using libraries like statsmodels or in R using built-in functions.

### A

Firstly, let's work on plotting the deviations \( Y_i - \hat{Y_i} \) against \( X_i \). To do this, we can:

1. Read the data into R.
2. Perform a simple linear regression.
3. Compute the residuals, \( Y_i - \hat{Y_i} \).
4. Plot the residuals against \( X_i \).

I'll provide an R script to achieve this:

```R
# Required Libraries
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Data
data <- read.table(header=TRUE, text="
age weight
224 574
222 522
... [other data lines] ...
120 348")

# Simple linear regression
model <- lm(weight ~ age, data=data)

# Compute residuals
data$residuals <- residuals(model)

# Plot the residuals against age
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, y=residuals)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype="dashed", color="red") +
  labs(title="Plot of Residuals vs Age", x="Age", y="Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
```

This code will generate a scatter plot of residuals vs age. Points above the red dashed line indicate that the model under-predicted the weight, and points below the line indicate an over-prediction. A perfect model would have all points on the line (i.e., zero residuals).

Similarly, for the second plot (deviations \( Y_i - \hat{Y_i} \) against \( \hat{Y_i} \)), you would just replace `x=age` with `x=fitted(model)` in the `aes` function of the `ggplot` call.

Now, the key part here is interpreting these plots. Patterns or trends in the residuals plot can indicate model mis-specification, non-linearity, or heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance of residuals). If the assumptions of linear regression are met, the residuals should be randomly scattered around zero without any clear patterns.

Remember, these plots are diagnostic tools. They can help you identify issues with your regression model, but the real test of a model is its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

### Q

Using the previous data I provided, can you conduct a test (t-test) to decide whether or not there is a linear association between weight and age.  Control the risk of Type I error at 0.05.
State the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion.  What is the P-value of the
test? Using R of course.

### A

Absolutely, let's walk through this.

1. **Hypotheses**:
   - Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \)): There is no linear association between weight and age, i.e., the slope of the regression line is zero (\( \beta = 0 \)).
   - Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_a \)): There is a linear association between weight and age, i.e., the slope of the regression line is not zero (\( \beta \neq 0 \)).

2. **Test to be Used**: We'll use a t-test on the regression slope.

3. **Decision Rule**: 
   - If the p-value is less than 0.05, we will reject the null hypothesis.
   - Otherwise, we will fail to reject the null hypothesis.

4. **Calculation using R**:

```R
# Your provided data
data <- read.table(header=TRUE, text="
age weight
224 574
... [other data lines] ...
120 348")

# Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(weight ~ age, data=data)

# Summary of the regression model
summary_results <- summary(model)
summary_results
```

5. **Conclusion**:
   - If the p-value for the `age` variable in the summary output is less than 0.05, then there's evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative, suggesting a linear association between weight and age. 
   - If the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, then there isn't sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

When you run the provided R code, you'll see the summary of the regression model. You should focus on the coefficient table. The `Pr(>|t|)` value next to `age` is the p-value for the t-test on the slope. Compare this value to 0.05 to make your decision. 

Finally, note that this test only assesses if there's a linear relationship. It does not indicate the strength or practical significance of the relationship, nor does it guarantee predictions made by the model will be accurate.

### A

I got an error when running your code. Sorry not being snippy. `Error in eval(predvars, data, env) : object 'weight' not found
Calls: lm ... eval -> <Anonymous> -> model.frame.default -> eval -> eval

### Q

I apologize for the oversight. The error suggests that there's an issue with recognizing the 'weight' variable in the dataset.

Here's the correct procedure to execute the t-test in R using the provided data:

```R
# Your provided data
data <- read.table(header=TRUE, text="
age weight
224 574
... [other data lines] ...
120 348")

# Make sure the data is correctly read
head(data)

# Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(weight ~ age, data=data)

# Summary of the regression model
summary_results <- summary(model)
summary_results
```

Please ensure that the data string in the `read.table` function includes all the data lines you provided. The ellipsis (`...`) is just a placeholder indicating where the rest of your data should be inserted.

After fitting the linear regression model, you can examine the `summary_results` to see the t-value, p-value, and other statistics related to the `age` predictor. The p-value of interest will be in the row corresponding to `age` in the `Pr(>|t|)` column of the coefficients table.

### A

Ah, I see the issue. You used commas `,` to separate the data fields, but `read.table` by default assumes spaces or tabs as delimiters. You should use `read.csv` for comma-separated values, or specify the delimiter in `read.table`.

Here's a corrected version:

```R
data <- read.csv(text="
age,weight 
224,574
222,522
220,498
218,598
218,417
218,338
217,453
217,410
217,463
139,453
120,348")

# Make sure the data is correctly read
head(data)

# Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(weight ~ age, data=data)

# Summary of the regression model
summary_results <- summary(model)
summary_results
```

Running the above should give you the results without any error.

### Q
What If I wanted to plot the regression line for the previous example?

### A



Certainly, you can use R's base plotting functions, along with the `abline()` function, to plot the regression line on a scatter plot of the data. Here's how you can do that:

```R
# Using the previous code...

# ... [Previous code to read the data and fit the model] ...

# Plot the data points
plot(data$age, data$weight, main="Regression of Weight on Age", 
     xlab="Age", ylab="Weight", pch=19, col="blue")

# Add the regression line
abline(model, col="red", lwd=2)
```

This will produce a scatter plot of the `weight` vs `age` data, and overlay the regression line in red.

### Q

Using the same data and results from the previous response, could you help me test whether or not B = 0 using an F-test with alpha = 0.05.  And also state the alternatives, decision rule, and conclusion

### A

Sure! Let's conduct the F-test to test whether the slope (\(B\)) is equal to 0.

**Hypotheses**:
- Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\)): \(B = 0\), i.e., there is no linear relationship between `age` and `weight`.
- Alternative Hypothesis (\(H_1\)): \(B \neq 0\), i.e., there is a linear relationship between `age` and `weight`.

The F-test in the context of linear regression tests whether the explained variance in the dependent variable (in this case, `weight`) is significantly greater than the unexplained variance. When applied to the slope of a simple linear regression, this test is equivalent to testing whether the slope is significantly different from zero.

**R code**:
```R
# Using the previous code...

# ... [Previous code to read the data and fit the model] ...

# Extract the F-statistic and the associated p-value
f_statistic <- summary_results$fstatistic[1]
p_value <- pf(f_statistic, df1=summary_results$fstatistic[2], df2=summary_results$fstatistic[3], lower.tail=FALSE)

f_statistic
p_value
```

**Decision Rule**:
If the p-value is less than \(\alpha = 0.05\), reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion**:
Execute the R code to get the `f_statistic` and `p_value`. Based on the p-value:

- If \( p \text{-value} < \alpha \), you reject the null hypothesis, concluding that there is a significant linear relationship between `age` and `weight`.
- If \( p \text{-value} \geq \alpha \), you fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that there is no significant evidence to suggest a linear relationship between `age` and `weight`.

Run the R code provided to determine the conclusion based on the computed p-value.

### Q

The previous example doesn't save any results to `summary_results` so this latest code snippet fails.

### A

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct that and ensure you can run the code to conduct the F-test and get the required results. Here's the revised code:

```R
# Reading the data
data <- read.table(header=TRUE, text="
age weight 
224 574
222 522
220 498
218 598
218 417
218 338
217 453
217 410
217 463
139 453
120 348")

# Fitting a linear regression model
model <- lm(weight ~ age, data=data)

# Getting the summary of the regression model
summary_results <- summary(model)

# Extracting the F-statistic and the associated p-value
f_statistic <- summary_results$fstatistic["value"]
p_value <- summary_results$coefficients[2,4]

cat("F-statistic:", f_statistic, "\nP-value:", p_value, "\n")

# Decision Rule and Conclusion
if (p_value < 0.05) {
  cat("Based on the p-value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between age and weight.")
} else {
  cat("Based on the p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant evidence to suggest a linear relationship between age and weight.")
}
```

After running the code, it will print out the F-statistic, the p-value, and the conclusion based on the decision rule.

### Q

What proportion of the total variation in weight remains “unexplained”
when age is introduced into the analysis?  Is this proportion relatively small or
large

### A

The proportion of the total variation in weight that remains "unexplained" when age is introduced into the analysis is given by the residual sum of squares (RSS) divided by the total sum of squares (TSS). In the context of regression analysis, this proportion is referred to as the "residual variance" or the "unexplained variance." It is quantified by \(1 - R^2\), where \(R^2\) is the coefficient of determination.

The formula for \(R^2\) is:
\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{RSS}{TSS} \]

Here:
- \( RSS \) is the residual sum of squares. It quantifies how much of the variability in the dependent variable (weight) is not explained by the independent variable (age).
- \( TSS \) is the total sum of squares. It quantifies the total variability in the dependent variable (weight).

If \(R^2\) is close to 1, it indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable. Conversely, if \(R^2\) is close to 0, it suggests that the independent variable does not explain much of the variability in the dependent variable.

Given the `summary_results` from the previous R code, the \(R^2\) value can be extracted using `summary_results$r.squared`. The proportion of unexplained variance is then \(1 - R^2\).

Let's compute the proportion of unexplained variance using the given data:

```R
# Computing the proportion of unexplained variance
unexplained_variance <- 1 - summary_results$r.squared

cat("Proportion of unexplained variance:", unexplained_variance, "\n")

# Determining if the proportion is relatively small or large
if (unexplained_variance < 0.5) {
  cat("The proportion of unexplained variance is relatively small.")
} else {
  cat("The proportion of unexplained variance is relatively large.")
}
```

Run this code after fitting the regression model and getting the `summary_results` as before. The output will tell you the proportion of the total variation in weight that remains unexplained when age is introduced into the analysis, and whether this proportion is relatively small or large.
