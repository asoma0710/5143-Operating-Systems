>**1**. Any projects that include programs as well as programs themselves must run without error. If they do not run, they will not be graded. Correctness is a different matter. However, the program must be close to the solution required and cannot be an over simplified version simply for the purpose of making it run. 
>
>**2**. ~~~The worth of the "homework/quizzes" section of the course will be calculated by a function based on the number of assignments and quizzes. If zero homeworks / quizzes are assigned then they will be assigned a 0% portion. If at least 10 are assigned then the full 25% will be assigned as its weight. If the full weight is not used the class will decide how the remaining percentage points will be assigned.~~~ 
>
>**3**. Plane ticket prices, events like weddings, or trips out of the country are not valid excuses for missing the final exam at its scheduled time. I will not make accommodations for anything other than an issue vetted by the dean of students. 

**Attendance:** Attending class is one of the primary keys to doing well in this class. Students with excessive absences may be reported to the dean of students and may receive a grade of F in the class. There is no distinction made between excused and unexcused. Make-up exams will be given only if the student has a reasonable excuse and if the instructor is contacted within 24 hours of the exam and arrangements are made for the make-up prior to the next class meeting. NO make-ups will be given for missed quizzes. Students are expected to be in the classroom when class begins and stay the entire period.

**Academic Policies:** Students should refer to the current MSU Student Handbook and Activities Calendar and the MSU Graduate Bulletin for university policies on academic dishonesty, class attendance, student rights and activities.
Disability Policy: In accordance with the law, MSU provides academic accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Students with disabilities must be registered with Disability Support Services before classroom accommodations can be provided. The DSS office is located in Clark Student Center, Room 168, phone 397-4140.

**Counseling Center:** MSU offers personal, group, career, and academic counseling. Students are encouraged to take advantage of these free services by contacting the Counseling Center: Room 108 Clark Student Center, 397-4618, counseling@mwsu.edu.

**Late Policy:** Assignments and programs will be accepted late up to two weeks after the due date with a penalty of 5 points per day. Late work will not be accepted for credit after two days from the due date.
