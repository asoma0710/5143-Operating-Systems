Simulating virtual memory involves managing the mapping between virtual addresses used by a program and physical addresses in the underlying memory system. Here's an overview of an approach to simulate virtual memory with a focus on page replacement algorithms:

1. **Define Virtual and Physical Memory**: Create data structures to represent both virtual and physical memory. Virtual memory consists of pages, which are the units of addressable space in a program. Physical memory consists of frames, which are the corresponding units of physical memory.

2. **Page Table**: Implement a page table to track the mapping between virtual pages and physical frames. The page table stores the mapping information for each page, including the page number and its corresponding frame number. It can also include additional information like valid/invalid bits, dirty bits, or reference bits.

3. **Page Fault Handling**: Simulate page faults that occur when a requested page is not present in physical memory. When a page fault occurs, you can implement a page replacement algorithm to select a victim page to be evicted from physical memory and replaced with the requested page. Common page replacement algorithms include Least Recently Used (LRU), First-In-First-Out (FIFO), and Clock algorithm.

4. **Page Replacement Algorithm**: Depending on the chosen page replacement algorithm, you need to implement the necessary logic to select a victim page for replacement. This involves considering page usage patterns, reference bits, and other relevant criteria specified by the algorithm. When a page is selected for replacement, update the page table accordingly and load the requested page into the selected physical frame.

5. **Memory Access Simulation**: As you simulate the execution of instructions in the machine language program, track memory accesses. When an instruction references a virtual address, consult the page table to translate the virtual address to a physical address. If the page is not present in physical memory, handle the page fault by applying the page replacement algorithm.

6. **Address Translation**: Implement address translation from virtual addresses to physical addresses using the page table. This translation ensures that the instructions access the correct physical memory location based on the virtual address.

7. **Monitoring and Metrics**: Collect statistics during the simulation, such as page fault rates, hit rates, and the behavior of the page replacement algorithm. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the simulated virtual memory system.

By simulating virtual memory, you can demonstrate the concepts of memory management, address translation, and the impact of page faults on program execution. You can also experiment with different page replacement algorithms and compare their performance and behavior in different scenarios.

Please note that this is a high-level overview, and the specific implementation details and level of detail may vary based on the desired complexity and educational objectives of your course.
