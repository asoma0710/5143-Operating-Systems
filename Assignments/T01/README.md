## Not Exam - Terms and Topics Relevant to Operations

## Due: 11-10-2024 - Final Exam Days

## Overview

- Create a **Wiki** for your operating systems repository by defining each of the terms in the list provided here: **[terms.md](./terms.md)**
- Use images and other content to ensure the reader can understand each concept.
- Use the instructions in [wiki.md](./wiki.md) to help you understand how to create a wiki for your repo as well as organize the wiki with the sidebar.
- This will count as your fourth and final project for the course.

### Deliverables

- I will clone your wiki from your repository to grade it. So nothing to physically hand in.
