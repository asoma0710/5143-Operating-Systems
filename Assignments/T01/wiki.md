## Creating a GitHub Wiki

GitHub Wikis are a powerful way to document your project, allowing for easy navigation and linking between pages. Here’s a step-by-step guide to create and organize a GitHub Wiki, including adding a sidebar with categories and linking pages.

### 1. Enabling the Wiki

1. Navigate to your GitHub repository.
2. Click on the “Wiki” tab at the top of the repository page.
3. If the Wiki is not enabled, click “Create the first page” to initialize it.

### 2. Creating Pages

1. Once the Wiki is enabled, you’ll see the main editor for your first page.
2. Add content using Markdown syntax, which GitHub Wikis support. For example:

```md
# Welcome to My Project Wiki

This wiki will guide you through the features and usage of the project.
```

3. Save the page by clicking “Save Page” at the bottom.

**Adding New Pages**

- To create a new page:
  1. Click “New Page” on the right sidebar.
  2. Name the page in the “Page Title” field (e.g., Getting-Started).
  3. Add content and save.

### 3. Creating the Sidebar

The sidebar allows you to organize and display links to your Wiki pages.

1. Accessing the Sidebar:
   - Create a page named \_Sidebar.
   - This page will act as the navigation bar for your Wiki.

- 2. Adding Categories and Links:
  - Use Markdown to organize pages into categories. For example:

```md
# Navigation

## Getting Started

- [Introduction](Home)
- [Installation](Installation)

## Features

- [Feature A](Feature-A)
- [Feature B](Feature-B)

## Advanced

- [API Documentation](API-Documentation)
- [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting)
```

3. Save the \_Sidebar page. It will automatically appear on the left side of your Wiki.

### 4. Linking Pages

- Use the following Markdown syntax to create links to other pages:

```md
[Page Title](Page-Name)
```

- For example, linking to a page named Getting-Started:

```md
[Getting Started](Getting-Started)
```

- To link external URLs:

```md
[GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com)
```

### 5. Organizing Pages

- Use hierarchical links in the sidebar to group related topics.
- Consider naming pages logically and categorizing them for ease of navigation.

### 6. Using Images

- Upload images directly to the Wiki using drag-and-drop or a Markdown link to an image hosted elsewhere:

```md
![Image Description](URL-or-uploaded-image-path)
```

### 7. Tips for a Professional Wiki

- Home Page: Use the default page (Home) as a welcoming introduction to your project.
- Search Functionality: GitHub Wikis have built-in search, so structure your content with clear titles and headers.
- Collaboration: Team members can edit the Wiki collaboratively, and changes are logged in the Git repository.

**Example Sidebar**

Here’s an example \_Sidebar structure for a typical project:

```md
# Wiki Navigation

## Overview

- [Home](Home)
- [Getting Started](Getting-Started)
- [Contributing](Contributing)

## Tutorials

- [Beginner's Guide](Beginners-Guide)
- [Advanced Features](Advanced-Features)

## Reference

- [API Documentation](API-Documentation)
- [Changelog](Changelog)
```

### 8. Managing Wiki Settings

- You can clone the Wiki as a separate Git repository for offline editing:

1.  Click “Clone Repository” from the Wiki page.
2.  Use Git to pull and push changes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.wiki.git
```

3. Edit Markdown files locally, commit changes, and push them back.
