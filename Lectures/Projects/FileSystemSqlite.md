## File System - Using Sqlite

This project is about creating a small virtual file system using SQLite.

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, and embeddable database engine that should work well for managing small-scale file systems. Below is a abstract approach to creating a file system with SQLite:

1. **Sqlite Data Types**:
   - NULL. The value is a NULL value.
   - INTEGER. The value is a signed integer, stored in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.
   - REAL. The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.
   - TEXT. The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).
   - BLOB. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input.

2. **Database Schema**:

   - Create an SQLite database that will serve as your virtual file system.
   - Design a table to represent files and directories. You might have columns like `id`, `name`, `parent_id` (to represent the directory hierarchy), `content` (to store file content), `size`, `type` (file or directory), and any other relevant metadata.
   - Define an appropriate primary key and any necessary indexes.
   - Possible schema: 
  
   | column name    | column type | description                     |
   | :------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------ |
   | `id`           | INTEGER     | Unique file id                  |
   | `name`         | TEXT        | String file name                |
   | `parent_id`    | INTEGER     | The unique id of the parent     |
   | `contents`     | BLOB        | The binary contents of the file |
   | `size`         | INT         | File size in bytes              |
   | `type`         | TEXT        | File or Directory               |
   | `date_created` | TEXT        | String rep of creation date     |
   | `date_changed` | TEXT        | Same but for when changed       |
   | `permissions`  | TEXT        | File permissions                |
   | `owner`        | TEXT        | File owner                      |
   | `group`        | TEXT        | File group                      |

3. **File Operations**:

   - Implement functions/methods to handle file operations like creating a file, creating a directory, deleting a file or directory, reading a file, writing to a file, listing files in a directory, etc.
   - When you create a new file or directory, insert a new record into your SQLite table. Ensure that you update the `parent_id` to represent the directory structure.

4. **Directory Traversal**:

   - Implement functions to traverse the virtual file system to locate files and directories.
   - You can use recursive or iterative methods to navigate the directory structure.

5. **Content Management**:

   - For file content, you can use the `content` column to store the actual file data. Depending on your needs, you might store binary data directly or encode it as text (Base64 or similar) for storage in the database.

6. **Error Handling**:

   - Implement error handling to manage cases such as file not found, insufficient permissions, or disk space, according to your project's requirements.

7. **Testing**:

   - Thoroughly test your virtual file system to ensure it behaves as expected. Test various scenarios like creating, deleting, and reading files and directories, handling edge cases, and checking for potential performance bottlenecks.

8. **API Design**:

   - Create a user-friendly API for your virtual file system that other projects can interact with. This might include a set of Python functions or classes that provide a convenient interface for file system operations.

9. **Security Considerations**:

   - In the real world, we would have to be cautious with security. Depending on the usage, we might want to implement access control, ensuring that only authorized users or processes can access certain files or directories.

10. **Backup and Recovery**:

   - Consider implementing backup and recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss.

11. **Documentation**:

   - Document your virtual file system thoroughly, including how to set it up, its API, and any important considerations for using it in other projects.

12. **Integration**:

    - Integrate the virtual file system into your other projects by importing the necessary modules or classes and using the provided API.

## Python Helper 

Creating a Python class for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an existing SQLite schema is a useful task. We'll start by importing the SQLite library, initializing a connection to the database, and then creating methods for each CRUD operation. Here's a Python class that demonstrates this:

```python
import sqlite3

class SQLiteCRUD:
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_name)
        self.cursor = self.conn.cursor()

    def create_table(self, table_name, columns):
        try:
            # Create a table with the given columns
            create_table_query = f"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} ({', '.join(columns)});"
            self.cursor.execute(create_table_query)
            self.conn.commit()
            print(f"Table '{table_name}' created successfully.")
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"Error creating table: {e}")

    def insert_data(self, table_name, data):
        try:
            # Insert data into the table
            placeholders = ', '.join(['?'] * len(data))
            insert_query = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} VALUES ({placeholders});"
            self.cursor.execute(insert_query, data)
            self.conn.commit()
            print("Data inserted successfully.")
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"Error inserting data: {e}")

    def read_data(self, table_name):
        try:
            # Retrieve all data from the table
            select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name};"
            self.cursor.execute(select_query)
            result = self.cursor.fetchall()
            if result:
                for row in result:
                    print(row)
            else:
                print("No data found in the table.")
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"Error reading data: {e}")

    def update_data(self, table_name, column, new_value, condition_column, condition_value):
        try:
            # Update data in the table based on a condition
            update_query = f"UPDATE {table_name} SET {column} = ? WHERE {condition_column} = ?;"
            self.cursor.execute(update_query, (new_value, condition_value))
            self.conn.commit()
            print("Data updated successfully.")
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"Error updating data: {e}")

    def delete_data(self, table_name, condition_column, condition_value):
        try:
            # Delete data from the table based on a condition
            delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE {condition_column} = ?;"
            self.cursor.execute(delete_query, (condition_value,))
            self.conn.commit()
            print("Data deleted successfully.")
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"Error deleting data: {e}")

    def close_connection(self):
        self.conn.close()
        print("Database connection closed.")

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    db_name = "my_database.db"
    crud = SQLiteCRUD(db_name)
    
    # Define table schema
    table_name = "students"
    columns = ["id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY", "name TEXT", "age INTEGER"]

    # Create table
    crud.create_table(table_name, columns)

    # Insert data
    data = (1, "Alice", 25)
    crud.insert_data(table_name, data)

    # Read data
    crud.read_data(table_name)

    # Update data
    crud.update_data(table_name, "age", 26, "name", "Alice")

    # Delete data
    crud.delete_data(table_name, "name", "Alice")

    # Close the database connection
    crud.close_connection()
```

This class, `SQLiteCRUD`, provides methods for performing CRUD operations on an SQLite database. You can customize it by specifying your database name, table schema, and the data you want to work with. Please adapt it to your specific use case as needed.
