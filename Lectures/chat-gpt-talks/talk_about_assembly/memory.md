Certainly! Here's a basic `Memory` class that you can use as a starting point for your pseudo-assembly interpreter. This class allows you to create and manage a simulated memory space where you can store and retrieve data by memory addresses:

```python
class Memory:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.memory = [0] * size  # Initialize memory with zeros

    def read(self, mem_addr):
        # Read data from memory at the specified memory address
        if 0 <= mem_addr < self.size:
            return self.memory[mem_addr]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Memory address out of bounds")

    def write(self, mem_addr, data):
        # Write data to memory at the specified memory address
        if 0 <= mem_addr < self.size:
            self.memory[mem_addr] = data
        else:
            raise ValueError("Memory address out of bounds")

    def dump(self):
        # Dump the contents of memory (for debugging purposes)
        return self.memory
```

In this `Memory` class:

- The `__init__` method initializes a memory space of the specified size with all zeros.
- The `read` method allows you to read data from memory at a given memory address. It performs bounds checking to ensure that the memory address is within the valid range.
- The `write` method allows you to write data to memory at a given memory address. It also performs bounds checking.
- The `dump` method returns the current contents of memory (useful for debugging).

You can create an instance of this `Memory` class and use it within your pseudo-assembly interpreter to simulate memory operations.

Example usage:

```python
# Create a memory space of size 1024 (for example)
memory = Memory(1024)

# Write data to memory
memory.write(10, 42)  # Write the value 42 to memory address 10

# Read data from memory
value = memory.read(10)  # Read the value from memory address 10

# Dump memory contents (for debugging)
memory_contents = memory.dump()
```

You can integrate this `Memory` class into your interpreter to simulate memory operations as needed.
